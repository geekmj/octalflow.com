Octal Flow is a publication dedicated to the craft of building modern software.  

We explore ideas across software architecture, system design, engineering practices, and the rapidly evolving world of technology.

The goal is simple: create clear, thoughtful, high-quality content that helps engineers and architects think deeper, design better, and build with intention.

Founded by [**Mrityunjay Kumar**](https://www.mrityunjay.com), Octal Flow exists at the intersection of practical engineering and long-term architectural thinking.  

Whether you're designing distributed systems, scaling products, or refining your engineering mindset, this space is meant to support your journey.
